// Description:
// A fix to the provided dining philosophers problem solution. The fix involves the introduction of a footman who will
// ensure that only 4 philosophers can eat at any one time. The footman is pretty much a semaphore that is used to
// control access to the table. The footman will allow a philosopher to eat only if there are less than 4 philosophers
// Issues:
// hopefully none
